Can you make a graph about number of pct 
ChatGPT
ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = pct)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "navy") +
  labs(x = "Percentage Support",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Distribution of Percentage Support") +

Make a graph representing Trump's support in each state based on state, write it in r language
ChatGPT
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Filter data for Donald Trump
trump_data <- polls_data %>%
  filter(candidate_name == "Donald Trump" & !is.na(state))

# Plot Trump's support by state
ggplot(trump_data, aes(x = reorder(state, -pct), y = pct)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "State", y = "Average Percentage Support", 
       title = "Donald Trump's Support by State") +

Statistical METHODOLOGY with r and make a graph for me with r
ChatGPT
# Calculate the count and percentage for each methodology
methodology_summary <- analysis_data %>%
  count(methodology) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Group methodologies with less than 5% as "Other"
methodology_summary <- methodology_summary %>%
  mutate(methodology = ifelse(percentage < 4, "Other", methodology)) %>%
  group_by(methodology) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(n), percentage = sum(percentage))

# Create the pie chart with labels
ggplot(methodology_summary, aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = methodology)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(fill = "Methodology", y = "Percentage", title = "Proportion of Methodology Types") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
